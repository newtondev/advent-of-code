# Advent of Code

My submissions for the [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) challenges written in Rust.

## Why Rust

I am learning Rust and thought this would be a good way to do it. I must admit that after some of these challenges I actually miss Python. However I will dig deep and push through.

## How to run

Enter the directory of the year in question.

Then to run the tests for an individual day, the inputs are the test input given on the examples:

```shell
cargo test --bin 01
```

To run the actual input received which will print out the results:

```shell
cargo run --bin 01
```

To run all the solutions for the specific year:

```shell
cargo run --bin aoc
```
